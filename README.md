# hello-world
following the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

I started as an accounting major, then took Fortran as a non-business elective, and loved it. 

My next programming language was Assembler, which I wouldn't have passed without help,
and because of it, all my other languages have seemed reasonably attainable.

I'm focusing on C# MVC and WinForms now, and I still love coding.
